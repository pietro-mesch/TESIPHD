\chapter*{Abstract}
This dissertation focusses on the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm based Real-Time Signal Coordination module for arterial traffic, as a proof of concept for the potential of integrating signal optimisation tools into a Real-Time Traffic Management System.
The endeavour represents an attempt to address a number of shortcomings observed in most currently marketed on-line signal setting solutions.
Within a fully functional traffic modelling and management framework, the optimiser can be developed independently, leaving ample space for future adaptations and extensions, while relying on the best available technology for its inputs, solution evaluation and visualisation, and command implementation.\\
The optimiser can then operate on a high quality network model that is well calibrated and continuously up-to-date with real-world road conditions; rely on robust, multi-source network wide traffic data, rather than being attached to single detectors; manage area coordination using an external simulation engine, rather than a na\"ive flow propagation model that overlooks crucial traffic dynamics; and even incorporate real-time traffic forecast to account for transient phenomena in the near \emph{future} to act as a feedback controller. \todo{finale}
