\chapter{Signalisation of Urban Networks} \label{c:basics}
The present work concerns the regulation of urban traffic by means of traffic signals.

The \emph{lights}, which are nowadays a ubiquitous feature of the urban landscape, first appeared in 1868 outside the British House of Commons in Victorian London, where the horse drawn carriage traffic was becoming an insurmountable barrier posing a serious threat to pedestrians.
Since then, and especially as motor cars were introduced, traffic regulation proved indispensable to administer the right of way among competing traffic flows and safeguard the more vulnerable users of the urban road environment.

This chapter introduces the formal representation of the signalised road network used for all practical purposes in this dissertation. It builds upon the definition of the network itself to describe the way it interacts with its users, modelling the problems that traffic signals need to tackle and the ways in which they might do so. Finally, the most relevant signal planning approaches based on the paradigm just outlined are illustrated, as they form the basis for the adaptive signalisation strategies to which the present work aims to contribute.

\section{The Urban Network} \label{s:urbannetwork}
In the context of transport modelling and planning, a transportation network is represented as a \emph{directed graph} in the mathematical sense, with the \emph{vertices} representing locations and the \emph{edges} connections that a user may travel between them. The term \emph{connection} is used loosely on purpose here, since in general these need not be \emph{roads} but may be transit lines, footpaths, railways etc. each with complex properties which determine its \emph{cost}, or even accessibility, to a given class of users.

In its extremely simplified acceptation of \emph{road network} which will serve the purposes of the present work, a transportation network may be reduced to an ordered pair $(\nodset,\arcset)$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\nodset$ is the set of vertices of the graph, called \emph{nodes}, representing junctions and road ends;
\item $\arcset$ is the set of directed edges between them, called \emph{arcs}, along which the users move.
\end{itemize}

This allows to encapsulate both the network topology and the properties of individual roads, which determine the way in which the users will interact with them: the choice of a path between two nodes depends on the perceived cost of each alternative as determined by a combination of its properties, e.g. length, toll, number of lanes, pleasantness; the same properties, albeit through conceptually different mechanisms, determines how the users will be able to move along the chosen path.



\section{Anatomy of a Signal Plan} \label{s:anatomy}
The following section briefly illustrates the main features of a signal plan devised for urban traffic regulation. This term encompasses all timings and schedules behind the delicate clockwork of traffic signals, from the elements that constitute a single signal program at one of the many junctions of the network, to the succession of network-wide program changes designed to meet the daily evolution of traffic demand and the propagation of vehicle flows.
The features presented in this section fully define what is commonly called a pre-timed plan, and as such do not describe any real-time actuation or decision making logic.
They are themselves, however, the decision variables of most optimisation methods and adaptive strategies, and it is crucial to understand their significance in order to appreciate the diversity of setting and control approaches illustrated in more detail throughout this chapter.

Elements of a network-wide signal plan: a daily schedule specifies the signal programs running at each intersection. The sequence and duration of signal phases repeats over the course of every signal cycle as specified by the different signal programs, administering junction capacity amongst the expected traffic flows. During each phase, a set of compatible manoeuvres is allowed through while the others remain closed.}{width=0.7\textwidth}

\subsubsection{Signal Phases}
Traffic signals exist mainly to separate conflicting traffic flows competing for the right of way at a road intersection. The natural way of doing so is to bundle compatible (e.g. non-secant) manoeuvres which may be safely performed simultaneously into signal phases, so that the corresponding flows may be allowed through the junction in turn.
Phases are the fundamental blocks of a signal program, and are usually repeated in the same order at every signal cycle, although some signalisation systems provide phase skipping, usually as part of their public transport prioritisation strategy.
Manoeuvres may pertain to different modes of transport, meaning that cars, trams and
pedestrians are taken into joint consideration and can be given the right of way during the
same signal phase.

Consider a junction, i.e. a network node $j \in \nodset$ where it is possible to perform a given set of manoeuvres $\manset_j$ .
The generic manoeuvre $y \in \manset_j$ may be:
\begin{itemize}
\item a turn, from an arc $ a \in \arcset_j^- $ of the node's backward star, to a forward star arc $b \in \arcset_j^+$ ;
\item a tram crossing or similar transport system specific operation;
\item a pedestrian crossing affecting one or more arcs either entering or leaving the junction.
\end{itemize}

In order to present a straightforward definition of \emph{manoeuvres} in relation to junction layout and signalisation, the focus will henceforth be on the movement of private vehicles only, unless otherwise specified.
It shall be clear that the principles of manoeuvre compatibility illustrated in this manner in Figure \ref{f:phasing} may be easily generalised to different and etherogeneous modes of transport, such as public transport, pedestrians and bicycles.

\fig{htbp}{PIX/phasing.png}{f:phasing}{
Manoeuvres at an intersection, conflict areas and possible phasing options: option A avoids
direct conflicts between Eastbound (E-) and Westbound (W-) manoeuvres, as would be desirable if high volumes were expected along that direction;
option B favours a lower number of phase changes (less time lost) assuming flows to be such that left turning vehicles have space to wait at the middle of the intersection, until the oncoming through flow decreases enough to let them cross.}{width=\textwidth}

Given the layout of a junction $j$, different manoeuvres may or may not
be safe to perform simultaneously, as exemplified in Figure \ref{f:phasing}.
This information, which may well depend on the flow conditions, is easily represented by a square Boolean matrix where rows and columns correspond to each manoeuvre and elements comply with the following rule:

\eq[.]{eq:phasing}{
\delta_{yz} = \left\lbrace 
\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \text{if $y$ and $z$ are compatible} \\
0 & \mathrm{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
\forall y,z \in \manset_j
}

Each possible subset of manoeuvres $p \subseteq \manset_j$ potentially identifies a \emph{signal phase}.
A viable set of phases $\phaset_j$ for the junction however must belong to the space of \emph{feasible} signal phases, i.e. all possible sets of manoeuvres contained in the power set $ \wp \left( \manset_j \right)$ whose elements are mutually compatible according to \req{eq:phasing}.
The union of all phases must also include every available manoeuvre at least once.

Formally, $\phaset_j$ must therefore comply with the following properties:
\eq[.]{eq:phaseset}{
\phaset_j = 
\left\lbrace 
p \in \wp \left( \manset_j \right) : \prod_{y \in p} \prod_{z \in p} \delta_{yz} = 1
\right\rbrace
\quad , \quad
\bigcup_{p \in \phaset} p = \manset_j
}

Clearly, the power set $\wp \left( \manset_j \right)$ contains sets of manoeuvres that, although compatible and technically feasible, make little practical sense.
The selection of an optimal set of phases $\s{P}_j$ satisfying relation \req{eq:phaseset} with respect to a specific objective (e.g. minimum total delay for given demand flows) is a combinatorial bi-level problem, usually solved through a \emph{what-if} approach in which the selection of a good set of phases remains largely a traffic engineer's task.

Conceptually, the determination of signal phases is thus driven by the interactions
between manoeuvres. From a practical point of view, however, administration of the right of
way by means of traffic signals cannot transcend the junction layout.
For example, it is only possible to separate manoeuvres into different phases if each has a dedicated lane that allows vehicles to queue for it without hindering traffic that is headed elsewhere. In fact, as everyday experience testifies, traffic signals do not allow or prohibit
manoeuvres directly, but rather regulate vehicle egress from lanes (or lane groups) dedicated
to specific sets of manoeuvres.

Each lane or group of adjacent lanes $a$ sharing the same manoeuvre set $\manset_a \in \manset_j$ can be conceptually assimilated into a \emph{lane group}: a single independent arc $a \in \arcset_j^-$
of the node backward star.
Let $\arcset_p$ be the set of lane groups which are given the green light during signal phase $p$,
and $\manset_a$ the manoeuvres that can be performed from lane group $a$.
The set of manoeuvres allowed during phase $p$ is therefore
\eq[.]{eq:lights}{
p = \bigcup_{a \in \arcset_p} \manset_a
}
The set of manoeuvres $\manset_a$ specific to each lane group $a$ is relevant for the determination
of the arc effective outflow capacity, which may be affected by partial conflicts with other
manoeuvres allowed during the same phase. Highway Capacity Manuals such as \hcm present practical
methods for quantifying such effects.

\subsubsection{Signal Programs}
A signal program contains the state switching times for all signals at a given junction.
For signal planning and optimisation, it is practical to view the program as a succession
of signal phases with specific durations, as portrayed in Figure \ref{f:plan}: during each phase a set of arcs are open, allowing users to carry out the corresponding manoeuvres, while the others arcs remain closed and accumulate queues.

A program for junction $j$ consists therefore of a cyclic set of instructions spanning a period called \emph{cycle time} $\cycle{j}$: given a phase set $\phaset_j$, these specify the start and end of each signal phase with respect to the beginning of the signal cycle.

Transitions between subsequent phases are usually enacted via pre-timed signal state change sequences that handle the closure of a set of lane groups before opening the next.

\subsubsection{Daily Schedule}
It is common practice to tailor several signal programs to the traffic conditions normally
observed at different times of the day, in order to meet each scenario with the best possible
allocation of resources. The daily schedule defines the sequence of programs that each
junction will run over the course of the day.

\subsubsection{Cycle Time}
The cycle time $\cycle{j}$ is the \emph{period} of the signal program, i.e. the time lapse between two occurrences of the same signal phase at a given junction.
It affects the average delay and the level of saturation at which the intersection may operate. In general, longer cycle times imply larger average delays, but increase the total throughput, which may be necessary to deal with high demand flows by attenuating the effects of the time lost in signal phase changes.

\subsubsection{Effective Green Shares}
The nominal duration of each phase $t_p$ is seldom exploited by demand flows at the full
capacity of the corresponding arcs: even assuming that vehicles are not held back by
downstream congestion, it is necessary to account for some transient phenomena affecting the
performance of a junction.

As the signals turn green at the beginning of each phase, some time is lost before the
queuing vehicles start moving, and some more passes before the flow through the stop line reaches the arc capacity.
On the other hand, if a lane group remains open during two subsequent phases such effects will be smaller, in proportion.
After taking into account all delays and extensions, the portion of cycle time during
which a given lane group a may allow traffic onto the junction at full capacity is referred to as
its \emph{effective green share}.
The absolute and relative durations of effective green experienced by lane group $a$ during phase $p$ are denoted respectively as:

\eq[.]{eq:gshr}{
\gren{a,p} \in \left[ 0, t_p \right]
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\gshr{a,p} = \frac{\gren{a,p}}{\cycle{j}}
}

It is not uncommon to have a lane group open during more than one phase: typically, an
approach experiencing high traffic volumes is given the right of way over two or more
consecutive phases without incurring further lost time in the phase change.

The effective green of each arc $a$ is then calculated from the total effective green time it
gathers over all relevant phases:
\eq[.]{eq:gshrtot}{
\gren{a} = \sum_{p \in \s{P}_j} \gren{a,p} \quad \text{with} \:
\left\lbrace \begin{array}{ll}
0 < \gren{a,p} \leq t_p 	&	\text{if} \, a \in \arcset_p	\\
\gren{a,p} = 0				&	\text{otherwise}		\\
\end{array} \right.
\quad \text{and} \quad
\gshr{a} = \frac{\gren{a}}{\cycle{j}}
}

\subsubsection{Signal Offset}
When multiple signals are involved, it is important to consider that vehicles that cross a signalised junction become packed into \emph{platoons}, which will eventually reach yet another signal-controlled stop line: adjusting the relative timing of adjacent junctions so that platoons meet a green light greatly affects the average delay incurred by the user. 

Synchronisation issues are addressed by defining a global time reference, with all junctions sharing the same cycle time or integer fractions thereof.
Each junction may then have all of its phase switching times anticipated or delayed in order to operate in concert with the neighbouring ones.
The amount of time $\toffs{j}$, by which the beginning of a cycle at one junction $j$ lags or leads the global reference instant, is referred to as a positive or negative \emph{offset}, respectively.
