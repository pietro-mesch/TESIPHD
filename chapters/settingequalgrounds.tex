\section{Setting equal grounds for comparison}
\todo{How to put Balance and TRE on equal grounds for a significant performance comparison.}

Considering the Balance requirements and settings illustrated in \ref{s:balreq} and \ref{s:balset} respectively, it is possible to try and put Balance in operation conditions that are as close as possible to those of the TRE based Bandwidth optimiser.

This requires restricting the decision space of Balance while providing it the maximum possible detection capabilities, and further aligning the cost functions to specifically compare the efficacy of the algorithms while factoring out all expected sources of discrepancy.

Per forzare il comportamento "solo offset" bisogna bloccare la durata degli stage, e lasciare libert√† totale a tutti gli interstage.}
